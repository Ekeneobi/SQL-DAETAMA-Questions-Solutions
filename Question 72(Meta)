Days since a users first session?
Calculate the number of days since a users first session. Assume today is 2022-05-26. Return answers sorted by days desc and user_id asc.

Table :
ig_user_sessions	
session_ts	datetime
session_type	text
user_id	bigint

Walt Through :
The solution to this problem will involve using windows functions date and rank . Date to find the difference between dates, rank to split the sessions order ascending so that the earliest date is giving rank 1.

solution:
[
WITH new_table AS
(
SELECT user_id,date(session_ts) date, rank() over(partition by user_id order by session_ts asc) rnk
FROM ig_user_sessions
)
SELECT user_id, date first_session, datediff('2022-05-26', date) days_since_first_session
FROM new_table
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1 ASC;
]
