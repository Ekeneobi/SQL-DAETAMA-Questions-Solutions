Which user worked in more than two distinct companies? 
Note that some users may have returned to the same job. Output the email address of these users in the ascending order.


Tables:

linkedin_emp_history	
user_id	bigint
employment	text
start_date	text
end_date	text

linkedin_users	
user_id	bigint
first_name	text
last_name	text
email	text
country	text
joined_dt	text
account_type	text

Walk Through:
Here I joined the tables using user_id , use windows function dense rank to group the employment company of users and select users that have more than 2 companies.

My solution:
[
WITH new_table AS
(
SELECT distinct(email), employment, dense_rank() over(partition by email order by employment) row_num
FROM linkedin_emp_history
LEFT JOIN linkedin_users USING(user_id)
)
SELECT email
FROM new_table
WHERE row_num > 2;
]

Optimal Solution:
[
SELECT email
FROM linkedin_emp_history
JOIN linkedin_users
USING(user_id)
GROUP BY email
HAVING count(distinct employment) > 2
ORDER BY emil;
]
